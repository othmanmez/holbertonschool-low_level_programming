# Singly Linked List Project
This project implements a singly linked list using C. It includes functions for adding nodes, counting elements, printing the list, and freeing the list.

## File Structure
- `lists.h`: Contains the structure definition and function prototypes.
- `print_list.c`: Contains the function to print all elements in the list.
- `list_len.c`: Contains the function to count the number of nodes in the list.
- `add_node.c`: Contains the function to add a new node at the beginning of the list.
- `free_list.c`: Contains the function to free all nodes in the list.
- `_putchar.c`: Contains the function to print characters (used in `print_list.c`).

## Functions
- `list_len`: Returns the number of nodes in a list.
- `print_list`: Prints all nodes in a list.
- `add_node`: Adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
- `free_list`: Frees all nodes in a list.
